# Smart Registration Services

A comprehensive university course-planning and registration system built with Django, designed to support students, advisors, and registrar staff through an integrated, modular architecture.

## Overview

Smart Registration Services is a modern web application that streamlines the course registration process at universities. The system provides:

- **Students**: Course search, schedule planning, conflict detection, and registration workflows

## Architecture

The system is built as eight independent but integrated modules:

### 1. Authentication & User Management
- CAS authentication integration
- Role-based access control (Student, Advisor, Registrar)
- User session management and permissions

### 2. Course Catalog & Search Engine
- Comprehensive course database with prerequisites
- Advanced search, filtering, and sorting capabilities
- RESTful API endpoints for course data

### 3. Student Planning & Schedule Visualization
- Interactive schedule builder
- Automatic conflict detection
- Visual weekly schedule views
- Advisor comment integration

### 4. Registration & Enrollment Processing
- Add/drop course functionality
- Mandatory advisor approval workflows
- Concurrent enrollment handling
- Registration audit logging

### 5. Advisor Collaboration & Messaging
- Real-time WebSocket chat system
- Plan review dashboard
- Comment and annotation tools
- Approval/rejection workflows

### 6. AI Recommendation & Degree-Planning
- Personalized course recommendations
- Degree requirement tracking
- AI-powered schedule optimization
- Learning from approval patterns

### 7. Notification & Event Trigger
- Email and push notifications
- Celery-based asynchronous delivery
- Event-driven notification triggers
- User notification preferences

### 8. Infrastructure, Performance & Data Pipeline
- System monitoring and logging
- API performance metrics
- Error handling and security
- Registrar data import pipelines

## Technology Stack

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LoganDawes/Smart-Registration-Services.git
cd Smart-Registration-Services
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Copy and configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

8. In separate terminals, start Celery and Redis:
```bash
# Terminal 2: Start Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 3: Start Celery worker
celery -A smart_registration worker -l info

# Terminal 4: Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks)
celery -A smart_registration beat -l info
```
